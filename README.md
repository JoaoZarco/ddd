Domain driven design (DDD) is an approach to software design that values simplicity and modeling code as closely to the business domain as possible. This results in code that can be easily understood by the business and evolved as the needs of the business domain change.

By isolating domain code away from all other concerns of the system like infrastructure, security, transportation, serialization etc; the complexity of the system grows only as large as the complexity of the business or problem domain itself.

If you are new to the concepts of DDD, it's highly recommended to do some background reading to grasp the motivations for this approach and to decide if it suits your application.

If you have already decided to use DDD for your application, this package is part of suite of purpose-built libraries that help you and your teams write large distributed node applications at enterprise scale and quality.
